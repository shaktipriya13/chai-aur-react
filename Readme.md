React is a library and not framework. frameworks hav very strict rules and syntaxes but react is cool guy

vite and parcel ek bundler jo bhut sare js files ko combine krke basic aapko 1 file de deta ha

If you want to build mobile apps using React Native along with react, you'll need to learn both React and React Native, but focus more on React Native.

 If your goal is web development, use React with react-dom lobraray

**Three.js** is a JavaScript library used to create and display **3D graphics** in a web browser.

**`npm`** (Node Package Manager) is used to install, update, or manage Node.js packages globally or locally, while **`npx`(node package executor)** is a tool to execute Node.js packages directly without globally installing them. For instance, you can run a package temporarily with `npx` without cluttering your system, making it ideal for tools like `create-react-app`. In short, `npm` manages packages, and `npx` runs them on-demand.

`create-react-app` is a software or utility but it is very bulky software so not preffered to use, so instead we use **vite and parcel**,they are also utilities like `create-react-app`


## package.json 

it is the entry point to understand any react app structure

The script in the context of a React project refers to the **commands** defined in the `package.json` file under the "scripts" section. These scripts are used to run specific tasks like starting the development server, building the project for production, running tests, or ejecting configurations.

1. **Start Script** : `npm start` runs your application in a development environment. It launches the development server and enables hot reloading to see changes instantly.

   ***Hot Reloading** means that when you make changes to your code, those changes are automatically updated in the running application  **without needing to refresh the page** . This feature is commonly used in development environments, especially in frameworks like React.*
2. **Build Process** : The `npm run build` command creates a production-ready version of your application. Since the browser understands only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this process compiles React components into optimized static files that browsers can interpret.
3. **Test Script** : `npm test` runs the test cases in your project to ensure functionality is correct.
4. **Eject Script** : `npm run eject` exposes the underlying configuration (e.g., webpack, Babel) used by Create React App. This is useful if you need to customize the setup but should be used cautiously since it makes the configuration harder to manage manually.

In essence, these scripts streamline project tasks and manage the development, testing, and production workflows efficiently.

by writing npm run build we get a new 'build' flder in which we get all the js code that we had written in our react app..when project is taken to production this build fldr is only served to all users and not the source fldr

The **build folder** in a React project (or similar frameworks) is the output of the production-ready code created by the  **build process** . When you run the command `npm run build`, the project is compiled, optimized, and bundled into files that browsers can understandâ€”HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. (**JavaScript files** : Bundled React components and libraries compiled into a few `.js` files.)

## we will be using Vite always to create react-app

vite,swelt are just another bundler that creates react app

* **Vite** : A modern build tool and development server that optimizes the development workflow for JavaScript-based frameworks like React.

![1736341255847](image/Readme/1736341255847.png)**Dev dependencies** are packages or libraries that are required only during the development process and are  **not included in the final production build** . These dependencies help with tasks like testing, bundling, transpiling, and code linting during development but are not needed for the application to run in production.

* node modules are not given with vite.so we need to install thm using npm i

***More dependencies** mean more code needs to be bundled and served to the browser. Larger bundle sizes can lead to slower initial page load times as the browser has to download and parse more files.*

To run app:

in every react and vite app we are given Readme.md .do update it accordingly
